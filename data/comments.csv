"Jul 3, 2016, 8:15:32 PM",I'm assuming that was a run?

"Jul 8, 2018, 11:35:46 PM",Stop running and get on a Citi bike. Lol
"Jul 28, 2018, 10:57:48 PM","We're not worthy. 😭 By the way Manny, we have to do a ride soon! "

"Aug 8, 2018, 9:48:31 PM",Yikes! I have a spare one. I'll send it to you. 
"Sep 20, 2018, 4:15:15 PM",Get a GPS watch. Syncs with Strava. https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B074KBWL9J/ref=dp_cr_wdg_tit_nw_mr?th=1
"Sep 30, 2018, 1:07:56 AM","Should have done the extra 0.01 mile! LOL!
"
"Oct 7, 2018, 2:27:16 AM",It is the slate :-) The CAAD10 is being replaced.
"Nov 5, 2018, 2:08:55 AM",Thanks! Are we doing a ride before winter sets in for good? 
"Nov 5, 2018, 2:09:10 AM",Let's try to set something up soon. 
"Nov 17, 2018, 9:45:18 PM",It was wet and messy! Washing the dirt off the bike right now. 
"Nov 17, 2018, 9:50:31 PM",Not by me. Puddles and some leftover slush everywhere. 
"Jan 9, 2019, 3:51:15 AM",Changing it up a bit with the location?
"Apr 22, 2019, 12:49:37 AM",Do you feel a difference over the 4000?
"May 17, 2020, 9:13:20 PM",Damn. Where's my invitation?
"May 24, 2020, 2:10:46 PM",Damn. You’re goons break 7 min soon!
"May 24, 2020, 10:01:22 PM",Spending some time at my in-laws during the shutdown. You’re not too far. We should try and do a ride together. 
"May 25, 2020, 12:32:36 AM",I had also tried the gatorskins on my commuter. Never again! I’d rather deal with flats all day long!
"May 25, 2020, 12:35:42 AM",I’ll be in the finger lakes region the whole month of June. Let’s plan a ride one of these days. 
"May 31, 2020, 12:47:55 AM",How were the streets?
"May 31, 2020, 1:06:18 AM",Too much running not enough biking!
"Jun 2, 2020, 12:52:23 AM",[strava://athletes/1920113/11]Paul Malaga I hate running so much! And it hates me just as much!! Any tips? 😂
"Jun 8, 2020, 10:13:51 PM",Trying! I much prefer the bike though. 
"Jun 8, 2020, 10:54:36 PM",Hey Manny. Did you see my text?
"Jun 8, 2020, 11:09:55 PM",[strava://athletes/1920113/11]Paul Malaga So far so good. I had to get a good pair of running shoes though. That’s made quite the difference! Have any advice to improve?
"Jun 8, 2020, 11:16:28 PM",All good with the family! Hope the same for you! What a crazy year! I’ll keep you posted for the ride. 
"Jun 15, 2020, 2:58:49 AM",I was able to make up some speed on the way back with a nice tail wind! 
"Jun 16, 2020, 9:52:29 PM",Hey Manny check WhatsApp when you get a chance. Let me know which day works best for you. 
"Jun 20, 2020, 11:11:56 PM",Great ride!
"Jun 21, 2020, 11:22:37 PM",Didn't know you could add kayaking on Strava. 😂 Nice one!
"Jun 26, 2020, 1:43:17 AM",I know the feeling. I’ve had to cut 2 rides short because of faulty replacement tubes. I’m seriously considering going tubeless. 
"Jun 28, 2020, 5:37:33 PM","Yeah, joined a bike club in Westchester. Very nice back roads around. "
"Jun 28, 2020, 5:38:09 PM",Finally on the bike!
"Jun 28, 2020, 8:38:22 PM",[strava://athletes/17634115/11]Lloyd Widom   Will do! Until the next ride! 
"Jul 6, 2020, 12:07:13 AM",Longest ride yet. Keep it up!
"Jul 12, 2020, 9:22:19 PM",Good to see you on the bike again [strava://athletes/707019/16]Priamo Hernandez !
"Jul 13, 2020, 1:00:23 AM",What are you doing in CT?
"Jul 17, 2020, 7:52:48 PM",[strava://athletes/2233769/11]Manny Loski You got the new Emonda??
"Jul 17, 2020, 8:06:20 PM",Agree! Send some pics!
"Jul 17, 2020, 8:11:15 PM",Ah ok. What didn't you like about it? Just curious.
"Jul 17, 2020, 8:46:04 PM","Yeah, the newer model is heavier than last year's be supposedly makes up for it by being a lot more aerodynamic. I thought it'd would run like a dream though. Don't believe the marketing hype! "
"Jul 17, 2020, 8:50:23 PM",Building a bike is a great project. My Storck was built from scratch. Also a great way to learn all about bicycle mechanics. Very easy to go way above budget though! Haha!
"Jul 18, 2020, 10:45:11 PM",Nice ride!
"Jul 20, 2020, 12:38:17 PM","[strava://athletes/2588733/17]Natalia Zamparini Yeah, it was a great ride! A bit too hot for my taste though. "
"Jul 20, 2020, 1:32:06 PM",[strava://athletes/190571/21]Christopher Schiffner Almost no cars except for a few stretches on main roads.
"Jul 21, 2020, 1:18:21 AM",I’ll be up there again next weekend. Let me know if you’re available for a ride. 
"Jul 21, 2020, 1:20:15 AM","Not far, Cayuga Lake. "
"Jul 24, 2020, 5:08:49 PM",Garmin is is down due to a possible ransomware attack and it looks like it could be a while before they're back up. Your best option is to manually upload through the data cable. 
"Jul 24, 2020, 5:09:56 PM",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/24/garmin-down-how-to-get-activities-on-strava-ride-swim-walk
"Jul 26, 2020, 1:04:10 AM",[strava://athletes/5642704/18]Richard Barthelemy Thanks. It was a beautiful day. 
"Jul 29, 2020, 3:37:39 AM",Thanks. Will definitely be back again!
"Aug 9, 2020, 1:27:00 AM",It was weird at first but you completely forget about it after just a few minutes. It is by far the most comfortable gravel bike I’ve been on! 
"Aug 22, 2020, 3:21:59 AM","[strava://athletes/190571/21]Christopher Schiffner If there was, it certainly wasn't noticeable. I think there's probably a point at which you'll feel it though, but 70 psi seems to be a sweet spot, at least for me. "
"Aug 22, 2020, 3:47:09 AM","They're 25mm. 

115!! Even with tubes I typically run them at 90-95 psi. More than that and it feels like I'm riding on wooden tires! haha!"
"Aug 23, 2020, 1:01:33 AM",Interesting podcast about why wider tires and lower pressure are faster. https://cyclingtips.com/2016/08/cyclingtips-podcast-episode-9-rethinking-road-bike-tire-sizes-and-pressures/
"Aug 23, 2020, 1:15:20 AM","Ha! Yeah, I now find myself with a bunch of tubes!"
"Aug 23, 2020, 1:17:40 AM","Yeah, that was quite the hill fest! By the way, I'll likely be upstate again next weekend. Let me know if you want to ride. I could also join RBC and ride with you guys."
"Aug 23, 2020, 1:27:12 AM","OK, thanks."

"Aug 23, 2020, 9:15:33 PM","Thanks [strava://athletes/190571/21]Christopher Schiffner !
"
"Aug 31, 2020, 12:43:40 AM",Didn’t make it. It was getting so late It was better to turn around. 
"Aug 31, 2020, 3:11:53 AM","[strava://athletes/2588733/17]Natalia Zamparini Yeah, the Cuomo bridge opens up all sorts of possibilities!"
"Sep 5, 2020, 7:46:43 PM",Try unpairing the garmin from the iPhone. 
"Sep 5, 2020, 9:39:36 PM",Must be mountain biking weekend! 
"Sep 5, 2020, 9:57:15 PM",I know! Had a blast! Definitely planning on doing more mountain biking before the end of summer. 
"Sep 5, 2020, 9:59:42 PM",Thanks! Hadn’t mountain biked since I was a kid! 
"Sep 6, 2020, 12:46:35 AM",That’s a monster ride! Nice!
"Sep 6, 2020, 3:01:08 AM",[strava://athletes/18661259/11]Cassy A Cid definitely will!
"Sep 12, 2020, 10:43:31 PM",You got it back! Nice! 
"Sep 12, 2020, 11:34:17 PM","Yeah felt good to do some climbing. Perfect weather too! By the way, are you not seeing the WhatsApp Messages?"
"Sep 20, 2020, 8:16:28 PM",Same here! Stay safe!
"Sep 20, 2020, 11:22:34 PM",Nice ride!
"Sep 30, 2020, 11:56:17 PM",It’s a Giant TCR. Made the switch to disc brakes. 
"Oct 1, 2020, 10:38:26 PM",Great looking bike! 
"Oct 3, 2020, 11:37:31 PM",[strava://athletes/55915057/10]Lexan Cruz Are you joining us next weekend?
"Oct 3, 2020, 11:38:00 PM",👍
"Oct 7, 2020, 12:18:39 AM",Damn!! How bad is the damage?
"Oct 7, 2020, 12:25:13 AM",Happy to hear you're okay!! These scooters are a menace!
"Oct 11, 2020, 11:27:02 PM",Thanks! Dude when are you riding with us? Winter’s coming! 
"Oct 11, 2020, 11:34:15 PM",[strava://athletes/190571/21]Christopher Schiffner Thanks!
"Oct 18, 2020, 8:14:41 PM",Very nice ride! Significant gains in the past few weeks! Next time I’m up there I want to check out Letchworth. 
"Nov 2, 2020, 12:01:19 AM",Really? I'll try to check it out next weekend.
"Nov 12, 2020, 11:56:33 PM",I think we were riding at the same time. Let's try to at least do a virtual meetup next time!
"Nov 13, 2020, 6:15:32 PM","Doing structured workouts or something like Zwift or FullGaz make it more enjoyable, or at the very least less boring. "
"Nov 21, 2020, 9:19:54 PM",Those are some nice rides! 
"Nov 27, 2020, 10:40:16 PM","Yeah, great route!"
"Dec 6, 2020, 8:37:05 PM",That’s quite the animosity towards Whoop. 😂
"Dec 6, 2020, 10:25:41 PM","Yeah, I get it. I stopped using mine a couple of months ago. The accuracy was way off for me. I got up twice in the middle of the night to walk the dog, including a 15 minute walk... Whoop: great night sleep! 🤔😂"
"Dec 14, 2020, 8:35:04 PM",It was a beautiful day here! Hard to believe we're in December.
"Dec 24, 2020, 5:28:42 PM",Nice! 
"Dec 26, 2020, 12:27:13 AM",Hey Naveen! Will be moving to the Bay Area in January and will be looking for people to ride with. Hope we can meet up at some point. 
"Jan 4, 2021, 3:08:28 AM",Packed up and on their way to SF.
"Jan 16, 2021, 10:26:52 PM",Ha! That’s exactly what I did today! What a first ride! 
"Jan 17, 2021, 1:56:01 AM",[strava://athletes/190571/21]Christopher Schiffner I couldn’t have asked for a better first ride!! 
"Jan 17, 2021, 2:28:51 AM","[strava://athletes/190571/21]Christopher Schiffner Are you upgrading the groupset? Campy? 😂 Yeah, trainers are almost impossible to find. In fact, anything bike related is impossible to find. "
"Jan 17, 2021, 2:29:35 AM",[strava://athletes/4052620/17]Vladimir Floresca It’s not even a fair comparison! 
"Jan 17, 2021, 2:36:51 AM",[strava://athletes/190571/21]Christopher Schiffner Noooo! Don’t join the runner’s club! 😂 sometimes taking it all apart and rebuilding is the best thing to do. Hopefully that solves all the problems. 
"Jan 17, 2021, 2:53:03 AM",[strava://athletes/523123/17]Naveen Nandigum Ⓥ Let me know if you’re up for a ride at some point. I’d like to explore some of the routes I’ve seen you do. 
"Jan 17, 2021, 2:53:43 AM",Whoa! Nicely done bro! 
"Jan 24, 2021, 7:12:08 PM",Yikes!
"Feb 2, 2021, 5:32:07 PM",Thanks Ryan!
"Feb 6, 2021, 5:19:24 AM",Is that Google tracking you? 
"Feb 6, 2021, 6:36:48 AM","Ah, got it! 😂"
"Feb 6, 2021, 6:37:40 AM",Let me know next time you want to ride. 
"Feb 7, 2021, 3:04:30 AM",Maybe 700-800. Can’t pinpoint exactly where it’s coming from. But it’s driving me up the wall!!
"Feb 7, 2021, 3:23:26 AM",It sounds more like a click and it seems like the crank/BB but who knows. My other bike was making a similar noise but it was the rear wheel. I just hate noises on my bike! I was ready to toss it down the mountain the other day! 😂
"Feb 7, 2021, 3:32:40 AM",Not ceramic. Nothing fancy.
"Feb 21, 2021, 1:39:15 AM",We should do that ride soon. Looks awesome! 
"Feb 25, 2021, 4:13:38 AM",That’s awesome! Definitely want to do that climb again! 
"Feb 28, 2021, 1:42:06 AM","Damn. Don't know how you stay so long on the trainer. After an hour I'm ready to toss it out the window! LOL!
"
"Feb 28, 2021, 1:44:05 AM","Have you given up on the bike? lol
"
"Mar 27, 2021, 12:17:40 AM",[strava://athletes/523123/17]Naveen Nandigum Ⓥ Trying hard so I can at least attempt to keep up with you on climbs. haha!
"Mar 27, 2021, 11:48:08 PM",It’s amazing! Let me know next time you’re in SF. Just moved out here. 
"Mar 29, 2021, 7:13:47 PM","Man, don’t think I could ride with you anymore Manny! You’d rip the legs off of me! "
"Apr 1, 2021, 4:48:56 PM",Thank you. It helps that the scenery is just amazing here!
"Apr 2, 2021, 6:54:02 AM",Well done!
