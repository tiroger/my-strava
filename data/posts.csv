Hello riders!

By now, most of us have a few rides under our belts and have mostly worked through the winter rust. I think the time is right for a good ride!

I propose heading up Route 9 to Nyack, NJ. We could all meet by the George Washington Bridge Saturday or Sunday morning and ride up together.

For those who are unfamiliar with Rt 9, it's a very nice, mostly stop-free and car-free ride for most of the way, with terrific views of the water in Piermont. There are two somewhat challenging hills (No Fear!), one on the way to Nyack and the other on the way back. The reward of course is lunch at the world famous Runcible Spoon!

Please let me know if you are interested and we'll work out the details.

Hoping to make this a successful one and more importantly to meet some of our new members.


Enjoy the rest of your week and try to stay dry. But if you can brave a little rain, well...Â 

Happy Riding!","",""
